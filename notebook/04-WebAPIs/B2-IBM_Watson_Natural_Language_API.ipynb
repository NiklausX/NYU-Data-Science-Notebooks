This happens because `GET` is designed to handle limited amount of data. When we have a large volume of data to send as parameters, then the HTTP protocol requires the use of the `POST` command. You will also see that the parameters that we pass are not \"flat\" as they used to be. Instead we submit the `watson_options` as the set of parameters, which is itself semi-structured.\n",
